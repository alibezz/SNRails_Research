# Define the list of icons to preview themes:
icons:
  - add.png
  - cancel.png
  - mass_mails.png
  - store.png

# Define the main html block for each finded theme:
generate_preview_block_code: |
  <div class="preview_icon_theme">
  %EACH_ICON_CODE%
  </div>

# Define the html code to show each icon:
generate_each_icon_code: |
  <div class="icon_num_%ICON_NUM%">
    <img src="%PATH%/%ICON_NAME%" />
  </div>

# The non obvious variables are:
#  %ICON_NUM% - each icon has a number equal to it's list position. It can help the layout definition.
#  %PATH% - the path for the theme.
#  %ICON_NAME% - the icon name without path (exatily equal the name on the icons list)
