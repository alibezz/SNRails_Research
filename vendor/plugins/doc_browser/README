= doc_browser plugin for Rails

Do you also think that's boring to browse your filesystem to reach the
documentation installed on your Rails application? Your probleams are over.

Install doc_browser plugin and browse your documentation from Rails'
development server.

== Usage

Install the plugin:

 ./script/plugin install https://svn.colivre.coop.br/svn/rails/plugins/doc_browser

The plugin installer will create a symbolic link in the public/ directory in
your Rails application, pointing to ../doc (your doc directory at the
application's root). If it doesn't (or if you remove it and decide to add
again), we can do the following:

 cd public; ln -s ../doc

That's it! Now point your browser at http://localhost:3000/doc and see all the
available documentation listed for you.

*Note:* doc_browser plugin is activated only in development mode. (i.e. when
<tt>ENV['RAILS_ENV] == 'development'</tt>)

== Knows limitations

* tested only with WEBrick
